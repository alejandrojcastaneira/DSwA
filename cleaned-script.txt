 This is the Asgardian refugee vessel Statesman. We are under assault, I repeat, we are under assault - The engines are dead, life support failing. Requesting aid from any vessel within range. We are 22 jump points out of Asgard.  Our crew is made up of Asgardian families, we have very few soldiers here. This is not a warcraft. I repeat, this is not a warcraft!



 Hear me, and rejoice. You have had the privilege of being saved by the Great Titan... You may think this is suffering... No. it is salvation. Universal scales tip toward balance because of your sacrifice. Smile...  For even in death, you have become Children of Thanos.



  I know what it's like to lose. To feel so desperately that you're right... yet to fail, nonetheless.  It's frightening. Turns the legs to jelly. I ask you, to what end? Dread it. Run from it. Destiny arrives all the same. And now, it's here. Or should I say... I AM.



  You talk too much.

  The Tesseract, or your brother's head. I assume you have a preference.



 Oh, I do. Kill away!



  ALL RIGHT, STOP!

 We don't have the Tesseract. It was destroyed on Asgard.



 You really are the worst brother.

  I assure you, brother... the sun will shine on us again.

 Your optimism is misplaced, Asgardian.

 Well, for one thing, I'm not Asgardian. And for another... We have a Hulk.



 Let him have his fun.



  Allfathers… let the dark magic flow through me one last... time.



 That was a mistake.



 NO!!!  You're going to die for that!

  Shhh.

  My humble personage… bows before your grandeur. No other being has ever had the might, nay the nobility, to wield not one, but two Infinity Stones. The universe lies within your grasp.



 There are two more Stones on Earth. Find them, my children, and bring them to me on Titan.

  Father, we will not fail you.

   If I might interject… If you're going to Earth, you might want a guide. I do have a bit of experience in that arena.

  If you consider failure experience.

 I consider experience, experience. Almighty Thanos, I... Loki... Prince of Asgard...  Odinson... The rightful King of Jotunheim... God of Mischief... do hereby pledge to you, my undying fidelity.



 "Undying." You should choose your words more carefully.



  You will... never be... a god. 

  No resurrections this time.



 No… Loki…









  Seriously? You don't have any money?

  Attachment to the material is detachment from the spiritual.

 I'll tell the guys at the deli.  Maybe they'll make you a metaphysical ham on rye.

 Oh, wait, wait, wait, I think I have 200.

 Dollars?

 Rupees.

 Which is?

 Uh, buck and a half.

 What do you want?

 I wouldn't say no to a tuna melt.



 Thanos is coming. He's coming...

  Who?





 Slow down, slow down. I'm totally not kidding.

  You're totally rambling.

  No, I'm not.

 Lost me.

 Look, you know how you're having a dream, and in the dream you gotta pee?

 Yeah.

 Okay, and then you're like, "Oh my god, there's no bathroom, what am I gonna do?" "Oh! Someone's watching." "I'm gonna go in my pants."

 Right. And then you wake up, and in real life you actually have to pee.

 Yes.

 Yeah. Everybody has that.

 Right! That's the point I'm trying to make. Apropos of that, last night, I dreamt, we had a kid. So real. We named him after your eccentric uncle. Uh, what was his name?

  Right.

 Morgan! Morgan.

 So you woke up, and thought that we were...

 Expecting.

 Yeah.

  Yes?

  No.

 I had a dream about it. It was so real.

 If you wanted to have a kid, you wouldn't have done that.



 I'm glad you brought this up, 'cause it's nothing. It's just a housing unit for nano particles.

 It's not helping your case, OK?

 No, no, it's an attachment, it's not a-

  You don't need that.

 I know. I had the surgery. I'm just trying to protect us. The future usses, and that's it. Just in case there's a monster in the closet, instead of, you know...

 Shirts?

 You know me so well. You finish all my sentences.

 You should have shirts in your closet.

 Yeah. You know what there should be? No more surprises. We're gonna have a nice dinner tonight. Show off this Harry Win-stone. Right? And we should have no more surprises. Ever. I should promise you.

 Yes.

 I will. 



 Tony Stark, I'm Doctor Stephen Strange. I need you to come with me. Oh, uh, congratulations on the wedding, by the way.



 I'm sorry, you giving out tickets or something?

 We need your help. Look, it's not overselling to say that the fate of the universe is at stake.

 And who's "we"?

  Hey, Tony.

  Bruce.

 Pepper.

 Hi.

 You okay?





  From the dawn of the universe, there was nothing. Then, boom! The Big Bang sent six elemental crystals, hurtling across the virgin universe. These Infinity Stones each control an essential aspect of existence.

  Space. Reality. Power. Soul. Mind. And Time.



  Tell me his name again.

 Thanos. He's a plague, Tony. He invades planets. He takes what he wants. He wipes out half the population. He sent Loki. The attack on New York. That's him.

  This is it... What's our timeline?

 No telling. He has the Power and Space Stones, that already makes him the strongest creature in the whole universe. If he gets his hands, on all six Stones, Tony...

 He can destroy life on a scale hitherto undreamt of.

  Did you seriously just say "hitherto undreamt of"?

 Are you seriously leaning on the Cauldron of the Cosmos?

 Is that what this is...?



   I'm going to allow that. If Thanos needs all six, why don't we just stick this one down the garbage disposal?

 No can do.

 We swore an oath to protect the Time Stone. With our lives.

 And I swore off dairy, but then, Ben & Jerry's named a flavor after me, so...

 Stark Raving Hazelnuts.

 It's not bad.

 A bit chalky.

 "A Hunka-Hulka Burning Fudge" is our favorite.

 That's a thing?

 things change.

 Our oath to protect the Time Stone cannot change. This Stone may be the best chance we have against Thanos.

 And still conversely, it may also be his best chance against us.

 Well, if we don't do our jobs.

  What is your job exactly, besides making balloon animals?

  Protecting your reality, douchebag.



 Okay, guys, could we table this discussion right now? The fact is that we have this Stone. We know where it is. Vision is out there somewhere with the Mind Stone, and we have to find him now.

  Yeah, that's the... thing.

 What do you mean?

 Two weeks ago, Vision turned off his transponder. He's offline.

 What? Tony, you lost another super bot?

 I didn't lose him. He's more than that. He's evolving.

 Who could find Vision, then?

  Shit.  Probably Steve Rogers.

  Oh, great.

 Maybe. But... 

  Call him.

 It's not that easy. God, we haven't caught up in a spell, have we?

 No.

 The Avengers broke up. We're toast.

  Broke up? Like a band? Like The Beatles?

 Cap and I fell out hard. We're not on speaking terms.

  Tony, listen to me. Thor's gone. Thanos is coming. It doesn't matter who you're talking to or not.



 Say, Doc, you wouldn't happen to be moving your hair, would you?

  Not at the moment, no.



 You okay?



 Help him! Wong, Doc.

 Go! Got it!

  F.R.I.D.A.Y., what am I looking at?

 Not sure, I'm working on it.

 Hey! You might wanna put that Time Stone in your back pocket, Doc!

  Might wanna use it.





  Ned, hey. I need you to cause a distraction.

  Holy shit! We're all gonna die! There's a spaceship!





 What's the matter with you kids? You've never seen a spaceship before?



 F.R.I.D.A.Y., evac anyone south of 43rd Street, notify first responders.

 Will do.





 Hear me, and rejoice. You are about to die at the hands of the Children of Thanos. Be thankful, that your meaningless lives are now contributing to...

  I'm sorry, Earth is closed today. You better pack it up and get outta here.

  Stonekeeper...  Does this chattering animal speak for you?

 Certainly not. I speak for myself.  But you’re trespassing in this city and on this planet. 

 It means get lost, Squidward!

 He exhausts me.

 

 Bring me the Stone.

  

 Banner, you want a piece?

 No, not really, but when do I ever get what I want?

 That's right.



 Been a while. Good to have you, buddy.

 I just... I need to concentrate here for one second. Come on, come on, man.

 Where's your guy?

 I don't know. We've sort been havin' a thing.

 There's no time for a thing.

 I know.

  That's the thing right there. Let's go.



  Dude, you're embarrassing me in front of the wizards.

 Tony, I'm sorry.  Either I can't or he won't-

 It's okay. Hey, stand down.  Keep an eye on him. Thank you.

 I have him.

 Damn it.



 Where'd that come from?

 It's nano-tech. You like it? A little somet-



 Dr. Banner, if the rest of your green friend won't be joining us...



 Gotta get that stone outta here, now.

 It stays with me.

 Exactly. Bye.



  Tony, you okay? How we doing? Good? bad?

 Really, really good. Really good. Do you plan on helping out?

 I'm trying. He won't come out.



 Hammer. 



  Come on, Hulk. What are you doing to me?  Come out! Come out! Come out!

  Nooooooo! 

 What do you mean, "no"?!



 Hey, man. What's up, Mr. Stark?

 Kid, where'd you come from?

 Field trip to MoMA.



 What is this guy's problem, Mr. Stark?

 He's from space. He came here to steal a necklace from a wizard.





 Your powers are quaint. You must be popular with children.



 It's a simple spell but quite unbreakable.

  Then I'll take it off your corpse.



 You'll find... removing a dead man's spell... troublesome.

 You'll only wish you were dead.  NO!

  Kid, that's the wizard. Get on it.

 On it!



  Not cool!



 Uhh, Mr. Stark? I'm being beamed up!

 Hang on, kid. 

 Wong, you're invited to my wedding.  Give me a little juice, F.R.I.D.A.Y. 



  Unlock 17-A.  Pete, you gotta let go. I'm gonna catch you.

 But you said save the wizard!  I can't breathe!

 You're too high up. You're running out of air.

 Yeah! That makes sense.



 Mr. Stark, it smells like a new car in here!

 Happy trails, kid. F.R.I.D.A.Y, send him home.

 Yep.



 OH, COME ON!



 Boss, incoming call from Miss Potts.

  Tony? Oh, my God. Are you all right? What's going on?

30 res.

 Why?

  Just 'cause I'll... probably not make it back for a while.

 Tell me you're not on that ship.

 Yeah.

 God, no. Please tell me you're not on that ship.

 Honey, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I don't know what to say.

 Come back here, Tony. I swear to God…

 Pep…

 Come back here right now! Come back!

 Boss, we're losing her. I'm going, too…



 Oh my God!  I should have stayed on the bus...







 Where you going?

 The Time Stone's been taken. The Sanctum remains unguarded. What will you do?

  I'm gonna make a call.







  Sing it, Drax!



  Why are we doing this again?

  It's a distress signal, Rocket. Someone could be dying.

 I get that, but why are we doing it?

 'Cause we're nice. And maybe whoever it is will give us a little cheddar cheese for our help.

  Which isn't the point.

  Which isn't the point... I mean… If he doesn't pony up…

 We'll take his ship.

 Exactly!

 B-b-b-bingo!



  We are arriving.

 All right, Guardians. Don't forget, this might be dangerous, so let's put on our mean faces.  Groot, put that thing away. Now. I don't wanna tell you again.  Groot.

  I am Groot!

 Whoa!

 Language!

 Hey!

 Wow.

 You got some acorns on you, kid.

 Ever since you got a little sap, you're a total d-hole. Keep it up, and I'm gonna smash that thing to pieces!





 What happened?

 Looks like we're not getting paid.



  Wipers! Wipers! Get it off!





 How the hell is this dude still alive?

  He is not a dude. You're a dude. This... This is a man. A handsome, muscular man.

  I'm muscular.

 Who are you kidding, Quill? You're one sandwich away from fat.

 Yeah, right.

 It's true. You have gained a little weight… 



 What? Gamora, do you think I'm…

 He is anxious. Angry. He feels tremendous loss and guilt.

 It's like a pirate had a baby with an angel.

 Wow. This is a real wake-up call for me. Okay. I'm gonna get a Bowflex. I'm gonna commit. I'm gonna get some dumbbells.

 You know you can't eat dumbbells, right?

  It's like his muscles are made of Cotati metal fibers.

  Stop massaging his muscles.  Wake him up.

  Wake.



 Who the hell are you guys?



 To bring balance to the Universe by wiping out half of all life. He used to kill people planet by planet, massacre by massacre...

 Including my own.

 If he gets all six Infinity Stones, he can do it with the snap of his fingers, like this. 

 You seem to know a great deal about Thanos.

 Gamora... is the daughter of Thanos.

 Your father killed my brother. 

 Oh, boy. Stepfather. Technically, she hates him as much as you do. 

 Families can be tough.  Before my father died, he told me I had a half-sister...that he imprisoned in Hel. Then she returned home, and stabbed me in the eye, so... I had to kill her. It's life, isn't it, I guess. Goes round and round and... I feel your pain.



 And I feel your pain, as well. I mean it's not a competition, but I've been through a lot. My father killed my mother, then I had to kill my father. And that was hard. Probably even harder than having to kill a sister. Plus, I, came out of it with both of my eyes-"

  I need a hammer, not a spoon…  How do I open this thing? Is there some sort of a four-digit code maybe… Maybe a birth date or something…

 What are you doing?

 Taking your pod.

  No, you're not!  You'll not, be taking our pod today, sir.

 Quill. Are you making your voice deeper?

 No.

 You are. You're imitating the god-man. It's weird.

 No I'm not.

  He just did it again!

 This is my voice!

  Are you mocking me?

 Are you mocking me?

 Stop it. You did it again.

 He's trying to copy me.

 Would you stop doing that? He's doing it first.

 Enough! We need to stop Thanos. Which means we need to find out where he's going next.

 Knowhere.

 He must be going somewhere.

 No. Knowhere? It's a place. We've been there. It sucks. Excuse me, that's our food. 

 Not anymore.

 Thor… Why would he go to Knowhere?

 Because for years, the Reality Stone has been safely stored, there with a man we call the Collector.

 If it's with the Collector, then it's not safe. Only an idiot would give that man a stone.

 Or a genius.

  How do you know he's not going for one of the other Stones?

 There's six stones out there.  Thanos already has the Power Stone because he stole it last week, when he decimated Xandar. He stole the Space Stone from me when he destroyed my ship and slaughtered half my people. The Time and Mind Stones are safe on Earth. They're with the Avengers.

 The Avengers?

  They're Earth's Mightiest Heroes.

 Like Kevin Bacon?

  He may be on the team. I don't know. Haven't been there in a while. As for the Soul Stone, well, no one's ever seen that. No one even knows where it is. Therefore, Thanos can't get it. Therefore, he's going to Knowhere. Hence, he'll be getting the Reality Stone. You're welcome.

 Then we have to go to Knowhere now.

 Wrong! Where we have to go, is Nivadellir.

 That's a made up word.

 All words are made up.



 Hold up, Nidavellir is real?  Seriously? I mean, that place is a legend.  They make the most powerful, horrific weapons to ever torment the Universe. I would very much like to go there, please.

 The rabbit is correct, and clearly the smartest among you.

 Rabbit?

 Only Eitri the dwarf king can make me the weapon I need.  I assume you're the captain, sir?

 You're very perceptive.

 You seem like a noble leader. Will you join me on my quest to Nidavellir?

 Lemme just ask the captain. Oh, wait a second, it's me! Yeah, I'll go.

 Wonderful.

 Except for that I'm the captain.

 Quiet!

 That's my backpack.

 Go sit down.

  Look, this is my ship. And I'm not goin' to…  Wait, what kind of weapon are we talking about here?

 The Thanos killing kind.

 Don't you think that we should all have a weapon like that?

 No. You simply lack the strength to wield them. Your bodies will crumble as your minds collapse into the madness.

 Is it weird that I wanna do it even more now?

 A little bit. Yeah.

 If we don't go to Knowhere and Thanos retrieves another stone, he'll be too powerful to stop.

 He already is.

 I got it figured out. We got two ships, and a large assortment of morons. So me and Groot will go with the pirate-angel here, and the morons will go to Knowhere to try and stop Thanos. Cool? Cool.

 So cool. 

  For the record… I know that you're only going with him because it's where Thanos isn't.

 You know, Quill, you shouldn't talk that way to your captain, Quill.  Come on, Groot. Put that game down, you'll rot your brain.

 I bid you farewell and good luck, morons. Bye.





 

 Vis? Is it the stone again?

 It's as if it's speaking to me.

 What does it say?

 I don't... I don't know. But something... 



 Tell me what you feel.



 I just feel you.



 So there's a 10 AM to Glasgow to give us more time together before you went back.

 What if I miss that train?

 There is an 11.

 What if I missed all the trains? What if this time, I didn't go back?

 You gave Stark your word.

 I'd rather give it to you.

 There are people who are expecting me too, you know. We both made promises.

 Not to each other.  Wanda… For two years, we've stolen these moments, trying to see if this could work. And... I don't know.  You know what, I'm just gonna speak for myself. - I, I... I think...

 It works.

 It works.

 Then stay. Stay with me.



  Or not. If I'm overstepping…



  What are they?

 What the stone was warning me about.  I have to go.

 No, Vision. Vision, if that's true… Then maybe going isn't the best idea.

 Wanda, I… 

 Vision! 





 The blade. It stopped me from phasing.

 Is that even possible?

 It isn't supposed to be.  My systems are failing.  I'm beginning to think... we should have stayed in bed.



 Vis!



  Give up the Stone, and she lives.









 Hands off.



  Come on. Come on. Come on, you gotta get up. You gotta get up. Come on. Hey. Hey. We have to go.

 Please. Please leave.

 You asked me to stay... I'm staying.

 Please.

 Get up.











  Get up.

 I can't.

  We don't wanna kill you. But we will.

 You'll never get the chance again.



  Can you stand?

  Thank you, Captain.

  Let's get you on the jet.

  I thought we had a deal. Stay close, check in. Don't take any chances.

 I'm sorry. We just wanted time.

 Where to, Cap?

 Home.

 

  Shhh. We'll be safe. We'll be safe.



 





  Zehobereians…

  Mother! Where's my mother?!

 Choose a side, or die.

 Mother! 

 One side is a revelation. The other, an honor known only to a few.



 What's wrong, little one?

 My mother. Where is my mother?

  What's your name?

 Gamora.

 You're quite the fighter, Gamora. Come. Let me help you.  Look. Pretty, isn't it? Perfectly balanced. As all things should be. Too much to one side, or the other…  Here. You try.



 Now go in peace, and meet your Maker.



 Concentrate. There! You've got it.



 Gamora. Do you know if these grenades are the "blow off your junk" kind or the gas kind? 'Cause I was thinking I might hang a couple on my belt right here. But I don't want to-

 I need to ask a favor.

 Yeah, sure.

 One way or another, the path that we're on leads to Thanos.

 Which is what the grenades are for.  I'm sorry. What's the favor?

 If things go wrong… If Thanos gets me… I want you to promise me… you'll kill me.

  What?

 I know something he doesn't. If he finds out… The entire Universe could be at risk.

  What do you know?

 If I tell you, you'd know, too.

 If it's so important, shouldn't I?

 Only if you wanna die.

 Why does somebody always have to die in this scenario?

 Just… trust me. And possibly, kill me.

 I mean, I'd like to. I really would… 

 Swear to me. Swear to me on your mother.

  Okay.



 Dude. How long have you been standing there?

 An hour.

 An hour? Are you serious?

 I've mastered the ability of standing so incredibly still... That I become invisible to the eye... Watch.



 You're eating a zarg-nut.

 But my movement... was so slow... that it's imperceptible.

 Mmm, no. 

 I'm sure I'm invisible.

 Hi, Drax.

  Damn it.



 This place looks deserted.

 I'm reading movement from the third quadrant.

 Yep. I'm picking that up, too. Let's put it down right here.



 I don't have it.

 Everyone in the Galaxy knows you'd sell your own brother if you thought it would add the slightest trinket to your pathetic collection.



 I know you have the Reality Stone, Tivan. Giving it to me will spare you a great deal of suffering. 

  I told you. I sold it. Why would I lie?

 I imagine it's like breathing for you.

 Like suicide.

 So you do understand. Not even you would surrender something so precious.

 I didn't know what it was.

 Then you're more of a fool than I took you for. Last chance, charlatan. Where's the Stone?

 Today...

  Drax. Drax.

 ...he pays for the deaths of my wife and daughter.

 Drax, waaaaait!  Not yet, not yet, not yet.  Drax, Drax, Drax. He doesn't have the Stone yet. We get it, and then we can stop him. We have to get the Stone first. Yeah.

 No. No. For Ovette. For Camaria.



 Sleeeep. 



 Okay. Gamora, Mantis, you go right. I'm...  The other right!



 Why?  Why you? Daughter… 

  That was quick.

 Magnificent! Magnificent! Magnificent!



 Is it sadness I sense in you, daughter? In my heart, I knew you still cared. But one ever knows for sure. Reality is often disappointing.



 That is, it was. Now… Reality can be whatever I want.



  You knew I'd come.

 I counted on it. There's something we need to discuss, little one.



 Thanos!



  Let her go, Grimace!

 Peter…

  I told you to go right.

 Now? Really?

 You let her go!

 Ah, the boyfriend.

 I like to think of myself more as a Titan-killing long-term booty call. Let her go.

 Peter…

 Or I'm gonna blow that nutsack of a chin right off your face!

 Not him.



 You promised! You promised.

 Oh, daughter. You expect too much from him.  She's asked, hasn't she? Do it.  DO IT!!

  I told you to go right.

 I love you, more than anything.

 I love you, too.



  I like you.



.)

 Still no word from Vision?

 Satellites lost him somewhere over Edinburgh.

 On a stolen quinjet with four of the world's most wanted criminals.

 You know they're only criminals because you've chosen to call them that, right, sir?

 My God, Rhodes, your talent for horseshit rivals my own.

 If it weren't for those Accords, Vision would've been right here.

 I remember your signature on those papers, Colonel.

  That's right. And I'm pretty sure I've paid for that. 

 You have second thoughts?

 Not anymore.



 Mr. Secretary.

 You got some nerve. I'll give you that.

 You could use some of that right now.

 The world's on fire. And you think, all is forgiven?

 I'm not looking for forgiveness. And I'm way past asking for permission. Earth just lost her best defender. So we're here to fight.  And if you wanna stand in our way... we'll fight you, too.

  Arrest them.

 All over it.  That's a court-martial. It's great to see you, Cap.

  You too, Rhodey. 

 Well. You guys really look like crap. Must've been a rough couple of years.

 Yeah, well, the hotels weren't exactly five star.

 Uh, I think you look great.  Uh... heh... Yeah. I'm back.

 Hi, Bruce.

 Nat.

  This is awkward.



 So we gotta assume they're coming back, right?

 And they can clearly find us.

 We need all hands on deck. Where's Clint?

 After the whole Accords situation, he and Scott took a deal. It was too tough on their families, they're on house arrest.

 Who's Scott?

 Ant-Man.

 There's an Ant-Man and a Spider-Man? Okay, look… Thanos has the biggest army in the universe. And he is not gonna stop until he... he gets... Vision's Stone.

 Well then, we have to protect it.

 No, we have to destroy it. I've been giving a good deal of thought to this entity in my head, about its nature. But also, its composition. I think if it were exposed to a sufficiently powerful energy source, something, very similar to its own signature, perhaps… Its molecular integrity could fail. 

 And you, with it. We're not having this conversation.

 Eliminating the stone is the only way to be certain that Thanos can't get it.

 That's too high a price.

  Only you have the power to pay it.  Thanos threatens half the Universe. One life cannot stand in the way of defeating him.

  But it should.  We don't trade lives, Vision.

  Captain, 70 years ago, you laid down your life to save how many millions of people. Tell me, why is this any different?



 Because you might have a choice. Your mind is made up of a complex construct of overlays. J.A.R.V.I.S., Ultron, Tony, me, the Stone. All of them mixed together. All of them learning from one another.

 You're saying Vision isn't just the stone?

 I'm saying that if we take out the stone, there's still a whole lot of Vision left. Perhaps the best parts.

 Can we do that?

 Not me. Not here.

 You better find someone, and somewhere fast. Ross isn't exactly just gonna let you guys have your old rooms back.

 I know somewhere.



 You'll have the Kingsguard, and the Dora Milaje have been alerted.

 And the Border Tribe?

 Those that are left.

 Send word to the Jabari as well. M'Baku likes a good fight.

 And what of this one?

 This one may be tired of war.  But the White Wolf has rested long enough.



  Where's the fight?

 On its way.



 In all the time I've served Thanos, I've never failed him. If I were to reach our rendezvous on Titan with the Time Stone still attached to your vaguely irritating person, there would be...judgement.  Give me... the stone.



 Wow you're a seriously loyal piece of outerwear, aren't you?

 Yeah, uh, speaking of loyalty...



 What the-

 I know what you're gonna say.

 You should not be here.



 I was gonna go home -

 I don't wanna hear it.

 But it was such a long way down and I just thought about you on the way...

 And now I gotta hear it.



 ...And I kinda stuck to the side of the ship. And this suit is ridiculously intuitive, by the way. So if anything, it's kinda your fault that I'm here.



  What did you just say?

 I take that back. And now I'm here in space.

 Yeah.  Right where I don't want you to be. This isn't Coney Island. This isn't a field trip. It's one-way ticket. You hear me? Don't pretend like you thought this through. You could not have possibly thought this through.

 No. I did think this through.

 You could not have possibly thought this through.

 It's just- You can't be a friendly neighborhood Spider-Man when there's no neighborhood.  Okay. That didn't really make any sense, but you know what I'm trying to say.

  Come on. We got a situation.  See him down there? He's in trouble. What's your plan? Go.

 Um. Okay, okay...uh...  Okay. Did you ever see this really old movie, Aliens?





 Painful aren't they? They were originally designed for microsurgery. And any one of them...



 ...could end your friend's life in an instant.

 I gotta tell you, he's not really my friend. Saving his life is more a professional courtesy.

  You've saved nothing. Your powers are inconsequential compared to mine.

 Yeah, but the kid's seen more movies.



 Yes! Wait what are those?!



 Hey, we haven't officially met.  Cool.



 We've gotta turn this ship around.

 Yeah. Now he wants to run. Great plan.

 No, I want to protect the stone.



  And I want you to thank me now. Go ahead, I'm listening.

 For what? Nearly blasting me into space?

 Who just saved your magical ass? Me.

 I seriously don't know how you fit your head into that helmet.

 Admit it. You should have ducked out when I told you to. I tried to bench you. You refused.

 Unlike everyone else in your life, I don't work for you.

 And due to that fact, we're now in a flying doughnut billions of miles away from Earth with no backup.



  I'm backup.

 No. You're a stowaway.  The adults are talking.

 I'm sorry, I'm confused as to the relationship here. Wh-what is he, your ward?

 No. I'm Peter, by the way.

 Doctor Strange.

 Oh, we're using our made-up names. Um... I'm Spider-Man, then.

 This ship is self-correcting its course. Thing's on autopilot.

  Can we control it? Fly us home?  Stark?

 Yeah?

 Can you get us home?

 Yeah I heard you. I'm thinking...I'm not so sure we should.

 Under no circumstance can we bring the Time Stone to Thanos. I don't think you quite understand what's at stake here.

  No. It's you who doesn't understand, that Thanos has been inside my head for six years since he sent an army to New York and now he's back! And I don't know what to do. So I'm not so sure if it's a better plan to fight him on our turf or his but you saw what they did, what they can do. At least on his turf, he's not expecting it. So I say we take the fight to him. Doctor. Do you concur?

  Alright, Stark. We go to him. But you have to understand... if it comes to saving you or the kid or the Time Stone... I will not hesitate to let either of you die. I can't, because the fate of the universe depends on it.

 Nice. Good. Moral compass. We're straight.  Alright, kid. You're an Avenger now. 





 I thought you might be hungry.



 I always hated that chair.

 So I've been told. Even so. I'd hoped you'd sit on it one day.

 I hated this room. This ship. I hated my life.

 You told me that too.  Every day. For almost twenty years.

 I was a child when you took me.

 I saved you.

 No. No. We were happy on my home planet.

 Going to bed hungry, scrounging for scraps. Your planet was on the brink of collapse. I'm the one who stopped that. Do you know what's happened since then? The children born have known nothing but full bellies and clear skies. It's a paradise.

 Because you murdered half the planet.

 A small price to pay for salvation.

 You're insane.

 Little one, it's a simple calculus. This universe is finite, its resources finite. If life is left unchecked, life will cease to exist. It needs correction.

 You don't know that!

  I'm the only one who knows that. At least, I'm the only one with the will to act on it.  For a time... you had that same will... as you fought by my side. Daughter.

 I'm not your daughter. Everything I hate about myself you taught me.

 And in doing so, made you the fiercest woman in the galaxy. That's why I trusted you to find the Soul Stone.

 I'm sorry I disappointed you.

 I am disappointed. But not because you didn't find it.  But because you did.  And you lied.



 Nebula.



 Don't do this.

 Some time ago, your sister snuck aboard this ship to kill me.

 Please don't do this.

 And very nearly succeeded. So I brought her here. To talk.



 Stop. Stop it.  I swear to you on my life. I never found the Soul Stone.



 You know what he's about to do. He's finally ready, and he's going for the stones. All of them.

 He can never get them all.

 He will!

 He can't, Nebula. Because I found the map to the Soul Stone and I burnt it to ash. I burnt it.



  You're strong. Me. You're generous. Me. But I never taught you to lie. That's why you're so bad at it.  Where is the Soul Stone? 

 Vormir!  The Stone is on Vormir.

  Show me.



  I am Groot.

 Tinkle in the cup. We're not looking. What's there to see? What's a twig? Everybody's seen a twig.

  I am Groot.

  Tree, pour what's in the cup out in space, and go in the cup again.

 You speak Groot?

 Yes, they taught it on Asgard. It was an elective.

  I am Groot.

 You'll know when we're there. Nivadellir's forge harnesses the power of a blazing neutron star.  It's the birth place of my hammer. It's truly awesome.



  Okay, time to be the captain. , presses two buttons] So, dead brother, huh? Yeah, that can be annoying.

 Well, he's been dead before, but this time I think it really might be true.

 And you said your sister and your dad?

 Both dead.

 Still got a mom, though?

 Killed by a dark elf.

 A best friend?

 Stabbed through the heart.

 Are you sure you're up to this particular murder mission?

  Absolutely. Rage, vengeance, anger, loss, regret...They're all tremendous motivators. They really clear the mind. So I'm good to go.

 Yeah, but this Thanos we're talking about... he's the toughest there is.

 Well, he's never fought me.

 Yeah, he has!

 He's never fought me twice. And I'm getting a new hammer, don't forget.

 Better be some hammer.

 You know, I'm 1,500 years old. I've killed twice as many enemies as that, and every one would have rather killed me, but none succeeded. I'm only alive because fate wants me alive. Thanos is the latest in a long line of bastards and he will be the latest to feel my vengeance. Fate wills it so.

 And what if you're wrong?

 If I'm wrong then... what more could I lose?



  I could lose a lot. Me personally. I could lose a lot.  Okay. If fate does want you to kill that crapsack... You're gonna need more than one stupid eyeball. 

 What's this?

 What's it look like? Some jerk lost a bet with me on on Contraxia.

 He gave you his eye?

 He gave me 100 credits. I snuck in later that night and stole his eye.

 Thank you, sweet rabbit.



 Hmm. Huh? Oh. I would've washed that. The only way I could sneak it off Contraxia was up my... Hey, we're here!

  I don't think this thing works. Everything seems dark.

 It ain't the eye.



 Something's wrong. The star's gone out. And the rings are frozen.





 I hope these dwarves are better at forging than they are cleaning. Maybe they realized they live in a junk pile in the middle of space.

 This forge hasn't gone dark in centuries...

  You said Thanos had a gauntlet, right?

 Yes. Why?

 Look anything like that? 

  I am Groot.

  Go back to the pod.



 Eitri, wait! Stop!

 Thor?



 What happened here?

 You were supposed to protect us. Asgard was supposed to protect us!

 Asgard is destroyed.  Eitri, the glove. What did you do?

  300 dwarves lived on this ring. I thought if I did what he asked, they'd be safe. I made what he wanted. A device capable of harnessing the power of the stones. Then he killed everyone anyway. All except me. "Your life is yours." he said. "But your hands are mine alone." 

 Eitri, this isn't about your hands. Every weapon you've designed, every axe, hammer, sword...It's all inside your head. Now I know all hope feels lost. Trust me, I know. But together, you and I, we can kill Thanos.



 Mantis, listen very carefully. I need you to meet me on Titan.



  Hey, what's going on?

 I think we're here.

 I don't think this rig has a self-park function.  Get your hand into this steering gimbal. Close those around it. You understand?

 Yep, got it.

 This was meant for one big guy, so we gotta to move at the same time.

 Okay. Okay. Ready.



 We might wanna turn. Turn! Turn! Turn!







  You alright?  That was close. I owe you one.



 Let me just say, if aliens wind up implanting eggs in my chest or something, and I end up eating you, I'm sorry.

  I don't wanna hear another single pop culture out of you for the rest of the trip. You understand?

 I'm trying to say that... something is coming.





  THANOS!!!! 

  AH! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! PLEASE DON'T PUT YOUR EGGS IN ME!



 Stay down, clown!



  Die, blanket of death!







 Alright, everybody, stay where you are... Chill the F out.  I'm gonna ask you this one time. Where's Gamora?

  Yeah, I'll do you one better. Who's Gamora?

 I'll do you one better! Why is Gamora?!

 Tell me where the girl is, or I swear to you, I'm gonna French-fry this little freak.

 Let's do it! You shoot my guy, I blast him. Let's go! 

 Do it, Quill! I can take it.

 No, he can't take it!

  She's right. You can't.

 Oh yeah? You don't wanna tell me where she is? That's fine. I'll kill all three of you and beat it out of Thanos myself.  Starting with you.

 What master do you serve?

 What master do I serve? What am I supposed to say? "Jesus"?

  You're from Earth?

 I'm not from Earth. I'm from Missouri.

 Yeah, that's on EARTH, dip-shit. What are you hassling us for?

  So, you're not with Thanos?

  WITH Thanos?! No, I'm here to kill Thanos! He took my girl. Wait... who are you?

  We're the Avengers, man.

 Oh.

 You're the ones Thor told us about!

 You know Thor!?

 Yeah. Tall guy, not that good-looking, needed saving.

  Where is he now?



 This is plan? We're gonna hit him with a brick?

 It's a mold. A king's weapon. Meant to be the greatest in Asgard. In theory, it could even summon the Bifrost.

 Did it have a name?

 Stormbreaker.

 That's a bit much.

 So how do we make it?

 You'll have to restart the forge. Awaken the heart of a dying star.

 Rabbit, fire up the pod.



 The heck happened to this planet? It's eight degrees off its axis. Gravitational pull is all over the place.



 Yeah, we got one advantage. He's coming to us. We'll use it. All right, I have a plan. Or at least the beginnings of one. It's pretty simple. We draw him in, pin him down, get what we need. Definitely don't wanna dance with this guy. We just want the gauntlet.



 Are you yawning? In the middle of this, while I'm breaking it down? Huh? Did you hear what I said?

 I stopped listening after you said, "We need a plan."

  Okay, Mr. Clean is on his own page.

 See, "not winging it" isn't really what they do.

 Uh, what exactly is it that they do?

  Kick names, take ass.

 Yeah, that's right. 

  Alright, just get over here, please. Mr. Lord, can you get your folks to circle up?

 "Mr. Lord." Star-Lord is fine. 

 We gotta coalesce. 'Cause if all we come at him with is a plucky attitude...

 Dude, don't call us plucky. We don't know what it means. Alright, we're optimistic, yes. I like your plan. Except it sucks, so let me do the plan, and that way it might be really good. 

 Tell him about the dance-off to save the universe.

 What dance-off?

 It's not a... it's not... it's nothing.

 Like in Footloose, the movie?

  Exactly like Footloose. Is it still the greatest movie in history?

 It never was.



 Don't encourage this, alright?

 Okay.

 We're getting no help from Flash Gordon here.

 Flash Gordon? By the way, that's a compliment. Don't forget, I'm half human.  So that 50% of me that's stupid? That's 100% you.

 Your math is blowing my mind.

 Excuse me, but... does your friend often do that?



 Strange! We alright?



 You're back. You're alright.

 Hey, what was that?

  I went forward in time to view alternate futures. To see all the possible outcomes of the coming conflict.

 How many did you see?

 14,000,605.

 How many did we win?



  One.



 The stone had better be up there...For your sister's sake.

.

 Welcome, Thanos, son of A'lars. Gamora, daughter of Thanos.

 You know us?

 It is my curse to know all who journey here.

 Where's the Soul Stone?

 You should know... it extracts a terrible price.

 I am prepared.

 We all think that at first.  We are all wrong.



 How is it you know this place so well?

 A lifetime ago, I, too, sought the stones. I even held one in my hand. But it cast me out, banished me here. Guiding others to a treasure I cannot possess.



 What you seek lies before you. As does what you fear.

 What's this?

 The price. Soul hold a special place among the Infinity Stones. You might say it has a certain wisdom.

 Tell me what it needs.

 To ensure that whoever possesses it... Understands its power... The stone demands a sacrifice.

 Of what?

 In order to take the stone you must lose that which you love. A soul...For a soul.



 All my life, I dreamed of a day...A moment when you would get what you deserved. And I was always so disappointed. But now...You kill and torture...And you call it mercy. The universe has judged you. You asked it for a prize, and it told you no. You failed. And do you wanna know why? Because you love nothing. No one.

 

 Really? Tears?

 They're not for him.



 No. This isn't love.

  I ignored my destiny once. I cannot do that again. Even for you.  I'm sorry, little one. 

 NO!







  Drop to 2600, heading 0-3-0.

 I hope you're right about this, Cap. Or we're gonna land a lot faster than you want to.



  When you said we were going to open Wakanda to the rest of the world...This is not what I imagined.

 And what did you imagine?

 The Olympics. Maybe even a Starbucks.



  Should we bow?

  Yeah, he's a king.

 Seems like I'm always thanking you for something. 



  What are you doing?

 Uh, we don't do that here.  So how big of an assault can we expect?



 Uh, sir, I think you can expect quite a big assault.

 How we looking?

 You will have my King's Guard, the Border Tribe, the Dora Milaje, and...

  A semi-stable, 100-year-old man.



 How you been, Buck?

 Uh, not bad, for the end of the world.



 Whoa. The structure is polymorphic.

 Right, we had to attach each neuron non-sequentially.

 Why didn't you just reprogram the synapses to work collectively?



  Because, we didn't think of it.

  I'm sure you did your best.

 Can you do it?

 Yes, but there are more than two trillion neurons here. One misalignment could cause a cascade of circuit failures.  It will take time, brother.

 How long?

 As long as you can give me.

  Something's entered the atmosphere.



  Hey, Cap, we got a situation here.



 God, I love this place.

  Yeah, don't start celebrating yet, guys. We got more incoming outside the dome.



  It's too late. We need to destroy the stone now.

  Vision, get your ass back on the table.

 We will hold them off. 

  Wanda, as soon as the stone's out of his head... you blow it to hell.

 I will.

 Evacuate the city. Engage all defense procedures.  And get this man a shield.



 I don't think you get the scientifics here. These rings are gigantic. You wanna get them moving, you're gonna need something a lot bigger to yank 'em loose.

 Leave that to me.

 Leave that to you? Buddy, you're in space. All you got is a rope and a-

 Fire the engines!

  Nnnyah!

  MORE... POWER... RABBIT!



 Well done, boy.



 That's Nivadellir!



 Damn it.

 "Damn it"? What's "damn it"?

 The mechanism is crippled.

 What?

 With the iris closed I can't heat the metal.

 How long will it take to heat?

 A few minutes, maybe more. Why?

  I'm gonna hold it open.

 That's suicide.

 So is facing Thanos without that axe. 



 How we looking, Bruce?

  Yeah, I think I'm getting the hang of it. Wow! It's like being the Hulk without actually-  I'm okay. I'm okay.

 I got two heat signatures breaking through the tree line.





 MAYEFA YA HU! MAYEFA YA HU! MAYEFA YA HU! MAYEFA YA HU! MAYEFA YA HU! 

  Thank you for standing with us.

  Of course, brother.



 Where's your other friend?

 You will pay for his life with yours. Thanos will have that stone.

 That's not gonna happen.

 You are in Wakanda now. Thanos will have nothing but dust and blood.

 We... have blood to spare. 



  Did they surrender?

 Not exactly.



  What the hell.

 Looks like we pissed her off.

  They're killing themselves.



  You seen the teeth on those things?

 Alright, back up, Sam. You're gonna get your wings singed. 



 Cap, if these things circle the perimeter and get in behind us...There's nothing between them and Vision.

  Them we better keep 'em in front of us.

  How do we do that?

 We open the barrier.  On my signal, open North-West Section Seventeen.

 Requesting confirmation, my King. You said open the barrier?

 On my signal.

  This will be the end of Wakanda.

 Then it will be the noblest ending in history.



 WAKANDA FOREVER!  Now!



  How much longer, Shuri?

 We've barely begun, brother. 

 You might want to pick up the pace.



 Allfathers, give me strength.

 You understand, boy? You're about to take the full force of a star. It'll kill you.

 Only if I die. 

  Yes. That's what... "killing you" means.



 Hold it! Hold it, Thor!



  Thor! Say something. Come on. Thor, you okay? 



 I think he's dying!

 He needs the axe! Where's the handle? Tree, help me find the handle!





 There’s too many of them! GYAH! AAAAHHHHH!



  AH-hahaha! You guys are so screwed now!

 BRING ME THANOS!!! 



  Oh, yeah, you're much more of a "Thanos".

 I take it the Maw is dead. This day extracts a heavy toll. Still, he accomplished his mission.

 You may regret that. He brought you face-to-face with the Master of the Mystic Arts.

 And where do you think he brought you? 

 Let me guess. Your home?

  It was. And it was beautiful.  Titan was like most planets. Too many mouths, and not enough to go around. And when we faced extinction, I offered a solution.

 Genocide.

 But at random, dispassionate, fair to rich and poor alike. They called me a madman. And what I predicted came to pass. 

  Congratulations. You're a prophet.

 I'm a survivor.

 Who wants to murder trillions.

 With all six stones, I could simply snap my fingers, and they would all cease to exist. I call that...mercy.

  And then what?

 I finally rest... and watch the sun rise on a grateful universe. The hardest choices require the strongest wills.

  I think... you'll find... our will... equal to yours.

 Ours? 

  Piece of cake, Quill.

  Yeah, if your goal was to piss him off!







.

 Boom!



  Do not let him close his fist. 



 Magic!  More magic!  Magic with a kick!  Magic with a-



 Insect!







 Well, well.

 You should have killed me.

 Would've been a waste of parts!

  Where's Gamora?!













  Is he under? Don't let up.

  Be quick. He is very strong.

 Parker, help! Get over here.  She can't hold him much longer. Let's go.

  I thought you'd be harder to catch. For the record, this was my plan. Not so strong now, huh? Where is Gamora?

 My... Gamora...?

 No, bullshit. Where is she?

  He is in anguish.

 Good.

  He… he… mourns.

 What does this monster have to mourn?!

 Gamora.

  What?

  He took her to Vormir. He came back with the Soul Stone... but she didn't.

  Okay, Quill, you gotta cool it right now, you understand?



  Don't, don't, don't engage, we've almost got this off!

 Tell me she's lying.  ASSHOLE! Tell me you didn't do it!

 I... had... to.

   No, you didn't…! No, you didn't…!   NO, YOU DIDN'T!!!

 Quill!



  Hey, stop! Hey, stop! Stop! Hey, stop! Stop!

 It's coming! It's coming! It's coming!  I got it! I got it...!



  Oh, God. 









  Come and get some, space dogs!  Come on, get some, get some! Come on, get some!  How much for the gun?

  Not for sale.

 Okay, how much for the arm?  Oh, I'll get that arm.



  New haircut?

  Notice you've copied my beard.



 By the way, this is a friend of mine. Tree. 

  I am GROOT!

  I... I am Steve Rogers.



 Fall back! Fall back now!



 Focus that fire on the left flank, Sam.

 I'm doing it. 



  Why was she up there all this time?



 She's on the field. Take it.





 Guys, we got a Vision situation here. 

 Somebody get to Vision!

 I got him! 

 On my way. 

  He'll die alone. As will you.

 She's not alone.



 Euuyaaah! 



 Ohh no, oh no you don't. This isn't going to be like New York, pal. This suit's already kicked the crap out of the Hulk- 

 Guys! Vision needs backup now!   Hulk. Hulk, I know you like making your entrance at the last second, well, this is it, man. This is the last, last second.  Ahhhhh! Hulk! Hulk! HULK!

  NOOOO!!!

 Oh, screw you, you big green asshole! I'll do it myself!  Come on!



 See ya!  Hulk, we got a lot to figure out, pal.





 I thought you were formidable, machine. But you're dying, like any man. 

 Get outta here!  GO!



 That was really gross.



  I thought I told you to go.

 We don't trade lives, Captain.



  I got you! I got you!  I'm sorry I can't remember anybody's names! 







 You're full of tricks, wizard.

  No!

  Yet you never once used your greatest weapon.  A fake. 



  You throw another moon at me, and I'm gonna to lose it.

 Stark.

 You know me?

 I do. You're not the only one cursed with knowledge.

 My only curse is you. 

 Come on!







  All that for a drop of blood.





 You have my respect, Stark. When I'm done, half of humanity will still be alive.  I hope they remember you.





 Stop!  Spare his life... and I will give you the stone.

 No tricks. 

 Don't..!



 One to go. 

 



  Where is he?!



  Did we just lose?

  Why would you do that?

 We're in the Endgame now.



 MAYEFA!

 YA HU!



  Are you okay?  What? What is it?

 He's here.



 Everyone, on my position. We have incoming. 

 What the hell?

  Cap. That's him.

 Eyes up. Stay sharp.









 Wanda. It's time.

 No.

 They can't stop him, Wanda, but we can. Look at me. You have the power to destroy the stone.

 Don't.

 You must do it. Wanda, please. We. Are. Out of time.

 I can't.

 Yes, you can. You can. If he gets the stone, half the universe dies.

 It's not fair.

 It shouldn't be you, but it is. It's all right. You could never hurt me. I just... feel you. 















  It's all right. It's all right. I love you.



  I understand, my child. Better than anyone.

  You could never.

  Today, I lost more than you can know. But now is no time to mourn. Now... is no time at all. 

 No! 





  I told you. You'd die for that!



  You should have... You...  You should have gone for the head! 

 NO!



 Daughter?

 Did you do it?

 Yes.

  What did it cost?

  Everything.



 What'd you do?  WHAT'D YOU DO?!



  Where'd he go? Thor... where'd he go?

 Steve?





  Up, General. Up! This is no place to die. 

 Kumkani?!

  I am Groot... 

 No... no. No. No. No! Groot, no.



  Sam? Sam!? Where you at?!



 Something... is... happening. 

  Quill? 

 Steady, Quill.

 Aw, man. 

  Tony, there was no other way. 

  Mister Stark? I don't feel so good...

  You're all right.

  I don't know what's- I don't know what's happening. I don't-  Save me, save me! I don't wanna go, I don't wanna go, sir, please. Please, I don't wanna go. I don't wanna go... I'm sorry. 

  He did it.



 What is this? What the hell is happening?

  Oh, God.



 Still no word from Stark?

 No, not yet. We're watching every satellite in both hemispheres, there's still nothing. 

 What is it?

 Multiple bogeys over Wakanda.

 Same energy signatures as New York?

 Ten times bigger.

 Tell Klein. We'll meet him at-

 Nick! 

 They okay?



 There's no one here.



 Call Control. Code Red.

 Nick?



 Hill?



 Oh, no. Motherf-
